Operating System definition:
____________________________

********************************************************************************
A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the
computer hardware.
********************************************************************************

_An operating system manages and abstracts the low-level hardware, so that, for
example, a word processor not need concern itself with which type of disk
hardware it is being used.

_An operating system shares the hardware among multiple programs so that they
"appear to run" at the same time.

_Operating system provide controlled ways for the program to interact, so that
they can share data or work together.

_An operating system also provides services to the user programs through an
interface.

_Designing a good user-interface is difficult. There is a trade-off between
ensuring the implementation is right and sophisticated features to the
applications.

Tasks of Operating Systems:

_Process Management
_Memory Management
_File Management
_I/O Management
_Network Management
_User and Security Management

______
Kernel
______

_"Kernel" is the one-and-only special program in a computer that provides
services to running programs.

_Each running program, called a process, has memory containing instructions,
data, and a stack.

_The stack organizes the program's procedural calls.

_When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes a system call, one
of the calls in the operating system's interface. The system call enters the
kernel; kernel performs the service and returns.

_____
Shell
_____

_The "shell" is an ordinary program that reads commands from the user and
executes them.

_Therefore, "shell" acts as an intermediary between the computer and the user.

_The shell is a user program, and not part of the kernel. Thus it is replaceable
with a variety of options to choose from.
